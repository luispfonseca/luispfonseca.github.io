### Version control with git
I've written a deck of [slides](/files/slides_git.pdf) teaching economists and other social scientists how to do version control with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). I have taught these slides to LBS PhD students and at a [workshop hosted by Banco de Portugal](https://www.bportugal.pt/en/evento/workshop-reproducible-research-and-modern-data-analysis-concepts-skills-and-tools).
